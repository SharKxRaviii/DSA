Problem Statement: Given an array that contains only 1 and 0 return the count of maximum consecutive ones in the array..

Examples
Example 1:
Input: prices = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1}
Output: 3
Explanation: There are two consecutive 1’s and three consecutive 1’s in the array out of which maximum is 3.

Example 2:

Output: 2
Explanation: There are two consecutive 1's in the array.

solution:
let arr = [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1];

function maxConsecutive (arr) {
  let count = 0;
  let max = 0;
  
  for(let i=0; i<arr.length; i++) {
    if(arr[i] === 1) {
      count++;
      if(count > max) {
        max = count;
      }
    } else {
      count = 0;
    }
  }
  
  return max;
}

console.log(maxConsecutive(arr));
