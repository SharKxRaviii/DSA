title: Remove Duplicate in-place

Problem Statement: Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. If there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of the array should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements. Examples Input: arr[]=[1,1,2,2,2,3,3] Output: [1,2,3,_,_,_,_] Explanation: Total number of unique elements are 3, i.e[1,2,3] and Therefore return 3 after assigning [1,2,3] in the beginning of the array. Input: arr[]=[1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4] Output: [1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_,_,_] Explanation: Total number of unique elements are 4, i.e[1,2,3,4] and Therefore return 4 after assigning [1,2,3,4] in the beginning of the array.


solution:
function removeDuplicates(arr) {
  if (arr.length === 0) return 0;

  let k = 1;

  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] !== arr[i - 1]) {
      arr[k] = arr[i];
      k++;
    }
  }

  return k;
}
