title: Move all Zeros to the end of the array

Problem Statement: You are given an array of integers, your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the end of the array and move non-negative integers to the front by maintaining their order.

Examples
Input: 1 ,0 ,2 ,3 ,0 ,4 ,0 ,1
Output: 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0
Explanation: All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order
Input : 1,2,0,1,0,4,0
Output: 1,2,1,4,0,0,0
Explanation : All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order

solution:
const arr = [1 ,0 ,2 ,3 ,0 ,4 ,0 ,1];

function moveZeros(arr) {
  let n = arr.length;

  while(let i=0; i<n) {
    if(arr[i] === 0) {
	arr.splice(i, 1);
	arr.push(0);
    } else {
	i++;
  }
  
  return arr;
}

console.log(moveZeros(arr)); // [1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0]
